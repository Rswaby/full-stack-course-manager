# service_api
A simple express app that performs basic crud commands using squelize as an orm.
This app creates new users and new courses. users and course share a relatioship. 
```json
{
        "id": 1,
        "title": "New Course Updated Again Hello",
        "description": "My course description. And again.",
        "estimatedTime": "12 hours",
        "User": {
            "id": 1,
            "firstName": "Joe",
            "lastName": "Smith",
            "emailAddress": "joe@smith.com"
        }
    }
```
